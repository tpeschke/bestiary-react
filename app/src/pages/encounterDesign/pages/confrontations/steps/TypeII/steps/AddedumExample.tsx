            <p>Now let’s sketch out a Confrontation where the players are the defenders.</p>
            <h1>Step 1: Determine Desired Action</h1>
            <p>The local church wants the players to clear the catacombs of the undead that have recently awoken.</p>
            <h1>Step 2: Determine Emotion(s)</h1>
            <p>I think they’ll try to guilt the players into doing it, calling on their sense of duty to the Divines.</p>
            <p>If that doesn’t work, they can call on the characters’ pride.</p>
            <h1>Step 3: Willingness & Ability</h1>
            <p>Now, at this stage, we’d check with our players to check their willingness and ability, although the assumption is that the character will feel up to the task.</p>
            <p>So, let’s say that one of the players says that the guilt won’t work on her character since she doesn’t like the church to begin with but we’ll still have the priest try that approach; it might work on the rest of the characters who’ll pressure that character into it.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Otherwise, the priest will leave for a few days and then come back and try to use the pride tact.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Failing that, they might try bribery; failing that, they’ll give up and find someone else.</p>
            <h1>Step 4: Set Skull</h1>
            <p>The church is full of particularly charismatic NPCs so we’ll make the envoy 2 Skulls.</p>
            <h1>Step 5: Set Ranks</h1>
            <p>This step is basically identical to the original example because we’re outlining the stats for the envoy that the church is going to send so we’ll only touch on things that are different:</p>
            <h2>Capacity</h2>
            <p>Capacity calculation is exactly the same but here’s the results of the brainstorming:</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>No And</strong> The characters walk away with a bad taste in their mouths; they increase a negative Relationship towards the church.</p>
            <p><strong>No But</strong> The characters walk away but will help find someone else to do the job</p>
            <p><strong>Yes But</strong> The characters will do the job but they get to keep what they find in the catacombs</p>
            <p><strong>Yes And</strong> the characters will do the job and they’ll help repair the church.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Now, just because the characters are not getting monetary reward doesn’t mean there won’t be kickbacks for helping the church and you might present these to the players as part of the Confrontation:</p>
            <p>“No, you won’t be getting paid for the job but the church will be grateful so you’ll increase their Relationship towards you which you can use for free healing and discounts to good in the town since they’re very powerful”.</p>
