            <p>We need to answer these questions:</p>
            <br />
            <ol>
                <li>Can the person (or people) do the desired action?</li>
                <li>Is the person (or people) willing to do the desired action?</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>For each answer, you want to also answer “why?” as it gives the players something to discover and strategize around. Do this even if you answered ‘yes’ to a question because then you know a bit more about the character and you can change things later in a believable way.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Answering “Yes” to both questions is valid and guarantees the Confrontation will happen; Answering “No” to both doesn’t mean a Confrontation is completely off the table - it just means that the players will have to work harder for it.</p>
            <p>While answering “Yes” to one and “No” to the other sits in the center.</p>
            <h1>Checking in with the Players</h1>
            <p>If the players are the intended targets of the Confrontation, reach out to your players and have them answer those two questions for their characters.</p>
            <p>If they answer “no” to one, ask them what might make their character change their mind.</p>
            <br />
            <p>If an NPC is trying to convince them in a way that wouldn’t work, have them attempt the original way first before trying a different tact. It’ll make the players feel like their character’s personality made a difference and that the world is a living place. The NPC can later adapt to a more successful tact later.</p>
            <h1 className="italic">Example</h1>
            <p className="italic">Let's take each in turn:</p>
            <h2 className="italic">Can the captain do the desired action?</h2>
            <p className="italic">Yeah, probably. It’ll be a bit of a financial strain but as long as the characters are only staying for 2 weeks every now-and-then, sure, he can host them on his dime.</p>
            <p className="italic">And this probably has more to do with the fact that he can levy additional food from the local villagers as part of the powers of his office.</p>
            <h2 className="italic">Is the captain willing to do the desired action?</h2>
            <p className="italic">Probably not; we’re assuming that the characters, at this point, are strangers and the captain probably doesn’t trust them.</p>
            <p className="italic">That being said, he probably has an interest in making sure the borderlands are free of threats and he’s certainly not going to go into the wilds to clean out the monsters.</p>
            <p className="italic">So, actually, I think, even though he might have misgivings, he would be open to hearing out the NPCs and seeing if they’re trustworthy.</p>
            <h2 className="italic">Conclusion</h2>
            <p className="italic">To sum up; the answers to both are “yes”.</p>
