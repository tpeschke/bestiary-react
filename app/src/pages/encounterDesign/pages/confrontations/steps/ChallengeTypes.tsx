            <h1>Type I</h1>
            <p>	Type I Confrontations are those where you inflict an Emotion, the players choose to try to resist it (either via a Conviction or by rolling) and then you move on.</p>
            <p>These are often environmental Emotions that are later capitalized by other enemies.</p>
            <h1>Type II</h1>
            <p>	Type II Confrontations are more traditional; one side is trying to convince the other of something.</p>
