            <p className="italic">I have two options for how often the swamp inflicts Fear on the characters: either every 4 hours or whenever the sun goes down. Those are two very different paces but both are fine - the watch pace is going to inflict Emotions at 4 times the rate of the sunset pace but the sunset pace is more thematic and feels more important because it is rarer and tied to a more specific in-world event.</p>
            <p className="italic">I’m going with the 4 hour pace because I really want this swamp to be small but hard to move through.</p>
