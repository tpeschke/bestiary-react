            <p>Don’t think too hard at this point; just list out everything that needs to be done to accomplish the task.</p>
            <p>Don’t edit at this point: even if a step is small, don’t forget to add it since not all steps will end up as Obstacles and some steps might be broken up in two or combined.</p>
            <h1>Single-Obstacle Challenges</h1>
            <p>Some Challenges are just a single action done over a long period of time or a number of actions that are going to be done in a mixed order or repetitively. Examples include climbing a uniform cliff face or smithing a weapon.</p>
            <br />
            <p>For climbing, it might make sense to break it into 1) across the scree, 2) the first ascent, and 3) climbing the overhang but for a cliff face that’s all the same angle, texture, and material it makes more sense to resolve it in one Check.</p>
            <p>For smithing a weapon, the smith is going to pour the metal and then heat, beat, heat, beat, etc. the metal. Instead of having the player do mixed, repeating Checks, it’s alright to combine this into one.</p>
            <br />
            <p>It takes a bit of horse-sense that’s developed through actually using the system but you’ll learn as you go (or might discover it as you get to Step 3).</p>
            <h1>Different Routes</h1>
            <p>You can give your players more options by offering different routes to the same goal. This works especially well for physical Challenges, like travel. You can reflavor a Dungeon Map, found in <a href="https://bonfire.stone-fish.com/gms/2-6">Chapter 2.6 of the GMG</a> to determine these routes.</p>
            <p>The only change you might make is to have the routes share the same start and goal and the rooms are Obstacles / steps. It can help you get ideas of what challenges you can throw at the players</p>
            <p>Monster Challenges</p>
            <p>Lock monsters will often times have Obstacles and / or Challenges already associated with them, which you can view in their entry; you can just take these wholesale or use them as a basis for creating a more complex Challenge (how would the Giant Spider Challenge change if it was part of a Challenge focused on looting the ruins of an ancient city?).</p>
            <br />
            <p>Other Skill Roles just provide Ranks that can be used as a form of Difficulty (trying to juke the elvish guardian to escape the room) or used to determine who overcomes a challenge first (the players and a rival adventuring party are both trying to navigate the trap-filled dungeon to seize the treasure first).</p>
            <h1 className="italic">Example</h1>
            <p className="italic">So, for this Challenge, there’s almost two parts: the actual research and then traveling to the location but I’m only going to focus on the research part.</p>
            <p className="italic">To find the blade, the players have to put together records that could be found in several libraries found around the Shattered Kingdoms so there’s at least 4 steps;</p>
            <br />
            <ol>
                <li className="italic">Identify whether or not a library has got a clue</li>
                <li className="italic">Travel to the library</li>
                <li className="italic">Sift through the records at the library</li>
                <li className="italic">Comprehend the tomes</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p className="italic">Step 4 is because the records are from ancient days, the players will require a Literacy Check to actually understand completely what they’re reading.</p>
