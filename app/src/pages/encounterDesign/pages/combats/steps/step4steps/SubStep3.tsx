            <p>Generally, if an enemy has time to prepare, they’ll change the terrain to favor their tactics so it helps to figure that out. Note that this can also apply to the players and friendly factions but we’ll talk about them from the perspective of the enemies.</p>
            <h1>Homefield</h1>
            <p>This is a place where the enemy has been able to extensively work the area to their advantage. &gt;90% of zones favor the defenders.</p>
            <p>Enemies with strategies involving traps will also employ them when they have the home field advantage.</p>
            <h1>Ambush</h1>
            <p>This is a place where the enemy has gotten to choose the terms of engagement but hasn’t had a ton of time / resources to extensively change it. ~75% of zones favor the defenders</p>
            <h1>Battlefield</h1>
            <p>Neither side has a clear advantage but both sides have agreed to fight here. ~50% of zones favor the defenders.</p>
            <h1>Neutral</h1>
            <p>Two factions randomly meet on the road: random.</p>
            <h1 className="italic">Example</h1>
            <p className="italic">And I’m going to say that this is an Ambush situation: the outlaws have picked the place but it’s not likely that they’ve had a ton of time to make it their own.</p>
