            <p>This is usually determined by the campaign and/or the players. If the main threats of the campaign are invading grunzen, and the players are going to attack one of their outposts, the enemy is going to be grunzen.</p>
            <p>But you might be able to mix in a couple of other enemies depending on the situation and what you’ve already set up in the campaign. For instance, the outpost might contain hunting wolves that the grunzen use or it might include a delegate of stercs who’ve been in talks with the grunzen about forming an alliance.</p>
            <h1>Difficulty</h1>
            <p>There will be very little talk about exact difficulty here because there are so many factors to the difficulty of a challenge that it is basically impossible to give you guidelines but my suggestion is to start with 1 Skull enemies and then work up from there as you and your players level up and learn the game.</p>
            <p>That being said, we’ll talk about difficulty in general, relational terms (‘this makes the combat more difficult’). Occasionally, these will just be noted with a + (harder) or - (easy) as a shorthand.</p>

            <p className="italic">The example I’m going to use is going to be for an imaginary campaign I’m just starting so I’m going to go through the Bestiary and find an enemy with a Beginner Combat Rating to get a read on the party’s abilities.</p>
